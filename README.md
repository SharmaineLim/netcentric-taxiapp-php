==================
** IMPORTANT **
- Push to (master) ONLY stable and working builds.
- Push to (dev) working source codes. No errors. (Keep your non-working source codes in your local repository instead.)
- ADD MESSAGES TO YOUR COMMITS. This will help you in the long run.

The use of multiple branches is encouraged.
( See http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/?demo )

** not as important **
- Minimize number of warnings.
